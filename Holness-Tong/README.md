# Holness-Tong


We should write a type checker next year
  (i) implement Hindley-Milner for a very simple function language, the old fashioned way
  (ii) re-implement it as a constraint solver - there was a vague plan to do this in week 2 of the ClojureLunch ( https://github.com/red-gate/ClojureLunch/blob/master/week-2-aim.txt )
  (iii) extend the constraint solver to allow GADTs and type families
